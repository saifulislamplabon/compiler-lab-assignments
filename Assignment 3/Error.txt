The way I implemented error is very naive and needs to write every specific error in grammar. Thats why I only implemented only few errors to demonstrate. I am looking for a better way to handle error. Then I will implement more errors.

Here are list of few error handling rule I implemented.


1. CLASS IDENT '(' NL  {
		line+=2;
		
		$$.code=strdup("");

		printf("%s\n","There must be { after class declaration." );
	}

2. WHILE '(' Expr  StmtBlock {
		$<E.code>$=strdup("");
		printf(") is missing at line %d\n",line-1);
	} 
	| WHILE  Expr ')' StmtBlock {
		$<E.code>$=strdup("");
		printf(" ( is missing at line %d\n",line-1);
	}

3. IdentAccess '=' Expr  NL {
		//ERROR
		$<E.code>$=strdup("");
		printf(" ; is missing.");
	}
